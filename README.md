# HacknPitch-Hackathon-2020

  <b> --- Organized by Jadavpur University E-cell </b>
</p>

<br></br>
> **Team Members :**
  - Shoif Md Mia
  - Abhishek De
  - Rajdeep Bhattacharya
  - Subham Goel
  
<br></br>
> **Project Theme :**
  - Smart traffic management - Nowadays traffic issue is a huge problem worldwide, so we tried to contribute a solution to this problem.

<br></br>
> **Objectives :**
  - Collision minimization
  - Congestion control
  - Prevent starvation
  - Giving Priority to special vehicles (e.g. Ambulance, Fire brigade, Govt. owned vehicle)

<br></br>
> **Technology used :**
  - YOLO (for vehicle detection)
  - Pygame - a python module (to show the simulation of traffic lights in an interface)

<br></br>
> **Project Sections :**
  - This project has two sections.
    - First one is **object detection** from video or image to get the data of vehicles and the congestion in a particular crossing
    - Second part is the **GUI**. It can use the data provided by the object detection part and using the vehicle data it shows how the traffic signals should act to prevent congestion and time loss.

<br></br>
> **Object Detection :**
  - This part uses YOLO for detection of vehicles.

> **Interface :**
  - This part shows the traffic signal simulation. Ambulance can be easily detected, Red cars are represented as govt. owned vehicle and the rest are normal vehicle.

  - <p align="justify"> At a critical situation to decide which lane should be given green signal we introduced a new factor, named as Traffic Factor. This is calculated by the waiting cars multiplied by their waiting time and the moving cars according to their priority as they will contribute to the congestion later. At a particular moment which lane has the highest traffic factor is the lane to be green. As an example look at picture 2 and picture 3, LANE II and LANE IV has higher traffic factor but LANE IV is cleared early as it has ambulance and ambulance should be given highest priority. </p>

  - <p align="justify"> To prevent starvation we have a maximum limit, if the limit achieved for the red light of a particular lane then that lane is immediately released. If we only consider the traffic factor then one situation may occur that one lane have to wait for infinitely long time and this would be a drawback of the system. </p>
  
  - <p align="justify"> To prevent congestion we have a minimum limit of green light for each lane. If a lane is released then it should be green for a minimun amount time such that the congestion can be reduced. </p>

> **Future Plans :**
  - Video detection (expensive but effective, will be installed only in busy intersections)
  - RFID vehicle detection
  - Partial detection scheme
