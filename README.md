> **Project Theme :**
  - Smart traffic management - Nowadays traffic issue is a huge problem worldwide, so we tried to contribute a solution to this problem.

<br></br>
> **Objectives :**
  - Collision minimization
  - Congestion control
  - Prevent starvation
  - Giving Priority to special vehicles (e.g. Ambulance, Fire brigade, Govt. owned vehicle)

<br></br>
> **Technology used :**
  - YOLO (for vehicle detection)
  - Pygame - a python module (to show the simulation of traffic lights in an interface)

<br></br>
> **Project Sections :**
  - This project has two sections.
    - First one is **object detection** from video or image to get the data of vehicles and the congestion in a particular crossing
    - Second part is the **GUI**. It can use the data provided by the object detection part and using the vehicle data it shows how the traffic signals should act to prevent congestion and time loss.

<br></br>
> **Object Detection :**
  - This part uses YOLO for detection of vehicles.
